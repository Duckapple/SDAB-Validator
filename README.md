# SDAB-Validator

This is a validator for the third assignment in the Systematic Design of User Interfaces course on ITU. 

It is very extensible, having the validators in separate python source files, 
so these validators can be edited or added on a whim.

## Capabilities
 - Check whether certain source file types are available
 - Check whether web-font are used
 - Check for use of :pseudo-classes in CSS
 - Check for reset.css
 - Validate HTML
 - Check for viewport meta-data
 - Import from LearnIT assignment zip file (just put in root directory of project and run `app.py`)
 - Export to markdown, with a .zipped bundle
